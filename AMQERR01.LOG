EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
79 (X'4F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
79 (X'4F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
79 (X'4F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r

ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
79 (X'4F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
79 (X'4F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r

ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
79 (X'4F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
79 (X'4F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host '122.101.1.147 (1480)' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host '122.101.1.147
(1480)' for channel TO.CRI400E was not successful. However the error may be a
transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP
conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
79 (X'4F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'122.101.1.147 (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the
relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

(1480)' for channel TO.CRI400E was not successful. However the error may be a
transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP
conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'122.101.1.147 (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the
relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host '122.101.1.147 (1480)' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host '122.101.1.147
(1480)' for channel TO.CRI400E was not successful. However the error may be a
transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP
conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'122.101.1.147 (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the
relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host '122.101.1.147 (1480)' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host '122.101.1.147
(1480)' for channel TO.CRI400E was not successful. However the error may be a
transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP
conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'122.101.1.147 (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the
relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host '122.101.1.147

transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP
conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host '122.101.1.147 (1480)' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host '122.101.1.147
(1480)' for channel TO.CRI400E was not successful. However the error may be a
transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP
conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'122.101.1.147 (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the
relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r

ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host

AMQ9202E: Remote host '122.101.1.147 (1480)' not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host '122.101.1.147
(1480)' for channel TO.CRI400E was not successful. However the error may be a
transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a TCP/IP
conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'122.101.1.147 (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform the
relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host 'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' not available, retry
later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'gua400r
(10.168.1.36) (1480)' for channel TO.GUA400S was not successful. However the
error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
78 (X'4E'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'gua400r (10.168.1.36) (1480)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.
